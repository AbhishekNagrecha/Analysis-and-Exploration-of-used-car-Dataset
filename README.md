# Used-car-dataset-exploration
In this repository I have explored the used-car-dataset which I found on kaggle.The task is of predicting the price of cars once they are used by the owners and are being thrown in the market.
Here I have tried to explore the dataset and understand its features.I have also performed extensive feature engineering to clean the dataset.
