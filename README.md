# Exploratory Analysis of Used Automobile Dataset
In this repository I have explored the used-car-dataset which I found on kaggle.The task is of predicting the price of cars once they are used by the owners and are being thrown in the market.
Here I have tried to explore the dataset and understand its features.I have also performed extensive feature engineering to clean the dataset.As far as data vaisualization is concerned I have utilized Bar graphs, Scatter plots, KDE and Multi-axix plots. Moreover I even explored Violin Plots and histograms.Box plots and heat maps gave valuble insights about any outliers and even used pie charts effectively.
